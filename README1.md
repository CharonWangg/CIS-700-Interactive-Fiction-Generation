# README for Pixray images and Adventuon

Pixray:
  I modified a pixray demo to generate some images of items and locations in my own game "Inception", Which includes beach, hotel, hall, box and etc.
  I have attached the images I generated and I am still working on the other parts and implementing the insertion of these images into my game runtime.
  
Adventuon:
  I used th the DFS function in the game_visualization and follow this path to generate the dictionaries which used to store the information of items, locations, and blocks,
  but there are some bugs in the last string genereation part and I am still working on!

Sorry for the incomplete accomplishment of either task! I got not much time these weeks to do this part.
